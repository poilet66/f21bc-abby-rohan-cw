# Abby's Notes

# 25/09/24

> ## Changes
>
> > - Made some necessary changes to perceptron class
> > - Changed the activation functions into functions rather than classes.
> > - Implemented an ANN (Unsure whether to use the for loop or reduce so done both will ask in lab)
> > - Implemented MAE Evaluation Metric
> > - Started looking into testing with dataset

> ## Considerations
>
> > - Might have to change things about as right now it can only handle a single output as a time but will need to handle batches of data to be used with dataset.
> >   > - Instead of 1D array should be a matrix where each row is an input.
> >   > - Should use matrix operations instead of vector.
> >   > - Once we fix this we _should_ be able to get rig of for loop i think?
> > - Unsure if dataset will need preprocessed or if thats been done before it was uploaded?
