I created these so we can keep notes if we want :) Can refactor it to be another filetype if that helps

Btw I recommend this extension (shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) as it lets you do checkboxes in markdown (and I think thats cool)

- Tried to add some type hinting to make referencing fields of classes (ANN/Perceptron) slightly nicer (not sure if it worked)
- Added string overide to Perceptron to make debugging easier (can do the same for ANN but lots of Perceptrons so maybe only worth checking one?)
- Created 'test' file (ideally should be in own module but we'll need to do some cleanup for that to work i think)
- Created (empty) particle class

# 18/10/2024

- Worked on defining Particle class, think its gonna be worth having a ProblemSpace class too (see comment in particle class)
- Defined problem space + some starter methods we'll need
