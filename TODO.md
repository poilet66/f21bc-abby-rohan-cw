# TODO

## Essential

- [ ] Implement other activation functions (ReLu & Tanh)
- [ ] Implement ANN (layers of perceptrons that feed into eachother)
- [ ] Implement PSO Algorithm
- [ ] Combine PSO & ANN
- [ ] Implement an evaluation metric
- [ ] Test on a regression task

## Might be nice

- [ ] Lambda implementation of perceptron (more extensibility)

## Quality of Life

- [ ] Virtual environment for package/vs code extensions?
- [ ] Split classes into separate files
